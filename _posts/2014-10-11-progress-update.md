So, those of you who've been keeping up with the site have noticed a few minor changes. I wanted to add my first impressions of working with this technology stack so far. Really, Jekyll and GitHub Pages abstract a lot of the hard stuff away from you, allowing you to focus more on style and content. It's not that I wouldn't like to customize the behavior of Jekyll, mind you (in fact, I really would, more details later). But having something that works out of the box for 99% of what I want to do is really refreshing. I haven't spent this much time in HTML5 and CSS3 in a long time.

That said, there are still some goals I'd like to accomplish (in no particular order):

* Responsive menu bar that collapses to a menu button on mobile devices.
* Clean up the Sass markup as it's already gotten pretty hairy (total side note, I love Sass).
* Add an "About" page that fulfills the link target from the nav bar.

Now, as for how I feel about the project so far:

1. I'm really surprised how little I've engaged with Ruby. Aside from `gem install bundler`, `bundle install`, and `bundle exec jekyll serve` I really haven't interacted with the code at all. Most of that has to do with the fact that I can't. I'd really like to customize the way the site processes the Sass assets so that I can inline most of my "above the fold" styles. But, that aside, there hasn't been anything I've wanted to modify, so I think Jekyll is a win for me, over more complicated `bower` based set ups.
2. Learning Sass has been really fun. It's such an intuitive style that I picked it up relatively quickly and it has really helped me so far. Changing the theme will simply be a matter of changing a few variables, what's not to like?
3. HTML5 is pretty great. This is my first real engagement with the new elements, but I really like the ones that are provided me. No more `<div>` tags everywhere. Yes, I am shockingly late to this game, and am embarrassed about this.
4. Mobile development with my Moto X and Chrome was really simple and very, very eye opening. There's no excuse for not testing your websites against the devices that you already own, and Chrome's `chrome://inspect` functionality makes it such a pleasure. I showed this off with this site and my phone at work and my coworkers were all as excited as I was about it, so I know I'm not alone in thinking this.
5. CSS3 has a lot to offer that I'm totally unfamiliar with. This has been, by far, the biggest hurdle for me, but one that, as someone who lists web development as an expertise, I need to jump. This is probably the most embarrassing part of doing this whole exercise: realizing just how far behind I am in some pretty fundamental ways. I have a bunch of experience with the frameworks behind the web apps, and even a great amount of UI experience, but that is mostly on the GWT platform where I'm using preconstructed widgets and tweaking styles as needed. Luckily, the GWT roadmap is looking pretty good in terms of modernization of the platform. That being said, I'm probably going to take my hobby projects and move them to a MEAN stack just to stay current.

Anyway, that's pretty much all I can think of for now. I'm going to keep plugging away at various things, but feel free to visit the GitHub repo and create issues if you find anything. I'll even accept pull requests if you want to help with some stuff, but I fully expect this to be pretty much solely on my shoulders.

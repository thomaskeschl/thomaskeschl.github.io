Welcome to my new blog! It's designed using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted by [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) (obviously).

I'm pretty new to Ruby, although I was introduced to it for a work project some months ago, so this is a way for me to ease myself into it. I'm dabbling in a little bit of everything: Golang, Dart, JavaScript, Python, Groovy and Clojure are all languages that I'm interested in and playing around with in some form or another. My main bread and butter, however, is Java. For the past 2 years I've been working in Java and the GWT web framework on a digital self-service document templating tool (though it's more than that), and I've had a blast.

I've always been interested in front end web applications development, being a true "code by hand in Notepad" snob for most of high school and college. But those were the early days (Web 1.0?) before JavaScript was a given and when animated gifs and the
'<blink>' tag were the epitome of high design. Now, I've grown used to my IDEs and autocomplete (though I still think GUI design tools produce too much cruft). At least I've shed Notepad for the much more stylish Atom text editor which I'm using as I write this.

I graduated with my MS in Computer Science in December of last year, which was a huge milestone for me as I had always wanted to go back and finish my CS degree from when I was an undergrad. In those years, I lacked the amount of focus required for the curriculum and opted for studying my other passion, writing.

Anyway, to get back on topic, my purpose here will be to highlight things I find particularly interesting in my coding projects (also hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com/thomaskeschl)) and perhaps discuss other programming related topics.

Here's to a fun filled future!

Something, something, something its been a while. Something, something, something, I've been busy. Blah blah blah. By now, if you're still with me, I'm sure you're used to seeing this seemingly obligatory text every time. Another new job came with a lot of changes in my life, and I've been pretty much unable to get back to coding in my free time.

However, I have found some time recently to, as you may have noticed, give the site a little update. The bones are still a mess (I'm convinced I can organize it in such a way that my editor doesn't bark at me for not closing tags), but now I'm using the [MDC library](https://material.io) that Google produced and shared. It's static site compatible and works out of the box for things like this. This is kind of the perfect use case, actually. The components were thought out and the philosophy behind it is more hands off than previous iterations. Plus, it's easy and well documented. I'd recommend giving it a shot.

In other news, I'm (re?)learning [Go](https://golang.org) for a new project and I'm falling back in love with the language. It makes Spring and Node projects look wordy.

Anyways, I hope this is the beginning of another productive stretch of coding for me, so keep checking in for more updates.

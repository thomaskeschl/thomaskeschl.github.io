A GitHub Pages blog set up with Jekyll.

If you wish to clone the project just to get a feel for what Pages and Jekyll can do, the setup instructions are simple:

1. Install Ruby and the Ruby DevKit.
2. `gem install bundler`
3. Navigate to the directory of your local clone.
4. `bundle install`
5. `bundle exec jekyll serve`
6. Navigate to [http://localhost:4000]

It's that easy. For more advanced Jekyll documentation, check out [http://jekyllrb.com].
